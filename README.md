1) Download and save "wotpack_installer.mpackage" somewhere easy to find on your computer.
2) Open mudlet, package manager (from the top toolbar), install
3) Navigate to the location you saved the .mpackage file and open it
4) You should get an automatic help message, otherwise type "wotpack install help"

5) To get the map, you will want to uninstall the generic mapper in package manager, then reopen mudlet.
6) Type "wotpack install mapper". When that completes, type "map update". Should that all work, you may wish to type "map debug" to turn off the debugging messages (if you don't see any debug messages after the first install, something didn't install properly).

7) To get a communications window that stores says/chats/nars/etc, type "wotpack install communications". 
8) I did NOT write this comms window, so will only be of minimal help if it misbehaves.
9) You may need to restart mudlet again for the comms window to look nicer/take effect.

10) You can type "wotpack view files" to get a list of all possible files available for download. This list is NOT displayed very neatly, hopefully I can change that in the future. You can use commands from the help message to install particular pieces, or everything. Most names should be self explanatory.


11) Please check the forums (http://www.wotmod.org/index.php) or the game discord (http://www.wotmod.org/viewtopic.php?f=74&t=7300) for more assistance if need be. I should be able to be reached by tagging @Adael in the Discord (preferably in the "mudclient_helpdesk" channel)
