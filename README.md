1) Download and save "wotpack_installer.mpackage" somewhere easy to find on your computer.
2) Open mudlet, package manager (from the top toolbar), install
3) Navigate to the location you saved the .mpackage file and open it
4) You should get an automatic help message, otherwise type "wotpack install help"

5) To get the map, you will want to uninstall the generic mapper in package manager, then reopen mudlet.
6) Type "wotpack install mapper". When that completes, type "map update"

7) To get a communications window that stores says/chats/nars/etc, type "wotpack install communications". 
8) I did NOT write this comms window, so will only be of minimal help if it misbehaves.
9) You may need to restart mudlet again for the comms window to look nicer/take effect.
