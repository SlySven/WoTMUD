1) Download and save "wotpack_installer.mpackage" somewhere easy to find on your computer.
2) Open Mudlet, open Package Manager (from the top toolbar of icons), and click install.
3) Navigate to the location you saved the .mpackage file, select it, and click open. It should now show up in the list of packages. Click ok.
4) You should see an automatic help message from the package installation on your screen.
  4.1) If not, try typing "wotpack install help" into the command line and hit enter.
  4.2) If no help message appears, something may have gone wrong.

Assuming everything worked properly, what you have just installed is a script that will handle downloading and installing other triggers/aliases/scripts/timers/keys/buttons/maps from this repository with commands sent through Mudlet.

5) To get the map, you will want to uninstall the generic mapper in package manager (if there is one in there), then reopen mudlet.
6) Type "wotpack install mapper". When that completes, type "map update". Should that all work, you may wish to type "map debug" to turn off the debugging messages (if you don't see any debug messages after the first install, something didn't install properly).

7) To get a communications window that stores says/chats/nars/etc, type "wotpack install communications". 
8) I did NOT write this comms window, so will only be of minimal help if it misbehaves.
9) You may need to restart mudlet again for the comms window to look nicer/take effect.

10) You can type "wotpack view files" to get a list of all possible files available for download. This list is NOT displayed very neatly, hopefully I can change that in the future. You can use commands from the help message to install particular pieces, or everything. Most names should be self explanatory.


11) Please check the forums (http://www.wotmod.org/index.php) or the game discord (http://www.wotmod.org/viewtopic.php?f=74&t=7300) for more assistance if need be. I should be able to be reached by tagging @Adael in the discord (preferably in the "mudclient_helpdesk" channel)
